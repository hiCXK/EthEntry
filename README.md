The challenge is to design and implement a decentralized ticketing system using
blockchain technology and Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs). This system will ensure
the authenticity of tickets, provide transparency in ticket transactions, prevent
unauthorized price inflation, and allow event organizers to profit from
secondary market sales.
